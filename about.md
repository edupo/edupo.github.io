			<h2>More?</h2>
		</header>
		<p>My work is not just a job, it's a passion, and I'm always eager to explore the latest and greatest technology available. However, I've learned that true success comes not just from individual brilliance, but from the synergy of a well-coordinated team. I thrive in a group that knows how to play Scrum, with each team member committing to the common goals and contributing their unique strengths to create something truly remarkable. As they say, anyone can whistle a symphony, but it takes a whole orchestra to play it.</p>
