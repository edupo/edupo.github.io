Looking forward to attending [Embedded World](http://www.embedded-world.eu/home.html) this year.

Nice keynotes and interesting topics at the conferences and classes about embedded development. The main title this year is, of course, [Internet of Things](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_of_Things) (IoT). Basically, an exciting new ecosystem for devices where every single piece of technology can publish information, and many other devices could analyze that big and real data and take decisions about their behavior. This futuristic concept is not only on paper anymore, but new technologies such as IPv6 or wireless sensor networks also are well known and they are enabling what will happen in the next few years.

_IoT is real_ and now many names in the market are moving towards new and amazing applications through many emergent technologies that allow developers to really push _distribution_ against its limits.

> It is the holy grail for automation!

I'm interested in security, a huge challenge in speaking about distributed architectures. But, In my opinion, is the perfect time to take challenges! Hope to see you at [Embedded World](http://www.embedded-world.eu/home.html)!
