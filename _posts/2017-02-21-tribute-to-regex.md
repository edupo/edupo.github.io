While tinkering with Regular Expressions today, a question popped into my head: Who was the genius behind this game-changing invention? I couldn't resist finding out, so I hit up Wikipedia and was blown away by what I discovered. The mastermind responsible for this amazing concept is none other than Stephen Kleene, and he deserves our utmost respect and admiration. In my humble opinion, he's an unsung hero who's contributed immensely to the progress of humanity. Thank you, Stephen Kleene!
