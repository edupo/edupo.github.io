The most used sentence to present yourself as a manager or leader in a team. _This is my brief analysis, a subjective point of view from a team member._

# "_My door_" means _there is_ a door

What a bad concept in a team!

Doors?

A team is a human network that **shares** information to carry out a task. A door is purely designed to block... Block noise, block people, block secrets!

Blocking is not a good concept for a team.

Please, '_my door_'?

Is it really _yours_?

You have a door and I don't? Is that fair?

A team of equal components can not have a door.

# "_is always open_" is a lie

A door is meant to be closed. Are you sure that I can enter your office when I want? Let me doubt it.

"_My door is always open._" implies that it is _you_ (the employee)__that will come to _me_ (your leader) when _you have_ a problem.

Is this not a terrible vision of a leader?

So the leader will be there for the team, but will not care for them until a problem triggers his/her reaction?

Your main business as a team leader is to **take care of your team**, your family, and your colleages...

In a summary, I should say that if you use the sentence "My door is always open" as your signature in your initial speech the confidence in you will become zero from the beginning. It implies that you will have better business than your team. So be careful about what you say the very first time if you join a team as a manager. Keep your people happy with you and with all the other team members. That will be your real business.
