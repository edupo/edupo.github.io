Today Rosetta lander has arrived at the surface of 67P! In a fully automated process to land with a communication delay of 30 minutes with mission control! I can not imagine the complexity of the electronics inside Rosetta and Philae (lander). But is really amazing... After **10 years** of mission and more than **3 months** of continuous measurements, the lander was finally deployed and landed today at 17 hours.

I suggest you check out some interesting pages, such as the [Rosetta Flickr](https://www.flickr.com/photos/europeanspaceagency/sets/72157638315605535/) or the [route simulation](http://sci.esa.int/where_is_rosetta/). Also the broadcast today was really interesting, check it out at <http://rosetta.esa.int/>.

The best thing about this project? In my opinion the great international interaction! Breaking borders!
