[Justice Palace, Antwerpen, Belgium. Time-lapse](https://vimeo.com/92121711) from [Maria Bote](https://vimeo.com/user26776093) on [Vimeo](https://vimeo.com).

This time-lapse was made between Mar√≠a Bote and me in Antwerpen in 2014 May. Is a brief experiment about how to produce such a thing. The shooter has implemented with [Raspberry Pi](http://www.raspberrypi.org/) a transistor and an infrared LED.

We really liked the experience!!
