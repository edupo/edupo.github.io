I've recently been working with [make](https://www.gnu.org/software/make/) and `makefiles` at work. What can I say about this tool with more than 20 years of life... It is an incredible tool which worth the effort to learn. I even recommend it to cross-compile from Windows! It is very flexible and reliable but talking clearly: is not the easiest building system. Anyway, I like to think that the best tools shouldn't be that easy.

As I started using the [manual](https://www.gnu.org/software/make/manual/\) I made a cheat sheet for myself. Now that I know `make` I want to share it with you: [make_cheatsheet](https://github.com/edupo/make-cheatsheet/raw/master/make_cheatsheet.pdf)

For any comment on how to improve it do not hesitate to contact me.
