Thanks to a college I've discovered [Node MC](https://learn.adafruit.com/adafruit-huzzah-esp8266-breakout/using-nodemcu-lua), a tiny system with great capabilities:

- **Lua** programming directly through the **USB-Serial interface** and a small and easy API.
- **Wifi** and a complete stack implemented and usable through the Lua API
- Generous amount of **GPIO** and other connections
- Several versions with USB connectors, without, tiny versions, etc...

> A fast and easy way to start playing with wireless and learning several good concepts about Wifi.

Software is accessible from [GitHub](https://github.com/nodemcu) where you can find not only the base repositories and tools but also lots of other related projects. The **ease to start working** with such a technology is the main advantage that makes me recommend this system to prototype, learn and play (of course). I don't want to discover this board (is very well described by its authors), but as I'm enjoying it very much, I hope you will find it interesting too.
