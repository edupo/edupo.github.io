After playing with Go for a couple of days, I finished the [tour](https://tour.golang.org). Actually, I learned a bit more by reading related articles and linked pages. I really recommend the experience as an initial attempt to understand go. As the last exercise, you are requested to program a simple web crawler. Find the code at the end of this post (I will not be much longer).

After a couple of hours of tinkering and recalling all the knowledge from the language I managed to complete the exercise--many things of this new language to interiorize. No significant conclusions yet about Go, but what I'm pretty sure about is how well it enforces recursion and concurrency in programs...
