Looking forward to going to [FOSDEM 2017](https://fosdem.org/2017/) in Brussels. It is my first time at an open-source conference! Since I started working with Linux I was attracted by open source. I didn't understand why somebody was able to give his job for free... I started using their code and getting into their amazing projects, building my own set of tools that nobody asked me to pay for... Every day, any of us uses thousands of lines of code written by an open-source community, it is so deep and so important that nobody is away from it. Now I understand the huge task open source is doing for all of us, and I want to join.

See you at the FOSDEM and remember: the future is being written by us and now more than ever before **_the future is being written by us_**.
