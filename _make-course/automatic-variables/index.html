<p>Automatic variables are an advance feature you may use <strong>inside your rules</strong>. These variables expand to very specific values regarding data available on rule's header.</p>
<p>[table th="0"]<br />
$@,$(@D),$(@F),Target's name<br />
$&lt;,$(&lt;D),$(&lt;F), First prerequisites<br />
$^,$(^D),$(^F), All prerequisites without duplicates<br />
$*,$(*D),$(*F), Implicit rule stem<br />
[/table]</p>
<p>Note D and F variations of the variable are actually splitting every word in Directory and File parts:</p>
<pre><code>$ cat Makefile
/tmp/file:
    @echo "The directory is $(@D)"
    @echo "The file is $(@F)"
$ make
The directory is /tmp
The file is file
</code></pre>
<p>Let's see the those in action with a complete example. Imagine you want to build a C program which needs one source file and at least 2 header files.     $ tree<br />
    .<br />
    ├── header1.h<br />
    ├── header2.h<br />
    └── program.c</p>
<p>So to build the program you need to generate a couple of implicit rules (You may use the <a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/make/manual/html_node/Catalogue-of-Rules.html#Catalogue-of-Rules">built-in rules</a> but you are stubborn and a DIY guy) so:     $ cat Makefile</p>
<pre><code>headers:= header1.h header2.h

program: program.o
    $(CC) $(CFLAGS) -o $@ $&lt;

program.o: program.c $(headers)
    $(CC) -c $(CFLAGS) -o $@ $&lt;

$ make program
cc -c  -o program.o program.c
cc  -o program program.o
</code></pre>
<p>This example is a little more complex so I'm going to take a closer look to every part of the line. - We decided to store all header file names in a variable so we can use it later. This is an easy task.     headers:= header1.h header2.h<br />
- Now we define our first target: program which has a prerequisite on it's object.     program: program.o<br />
        $(CC) $(CFLAGS) -o $@ $&lt;;</p>
<p>Here we used 2 automatic variables. And the expansion of the recipe looks like:     cc  -o program program.o</p>
<p>As you can see the automatic variables has done their work pretty well!<br />
- Last we can see the rule for making the object file and it's output fits what was described.</p>
<pre><code>program.o: program.c $(headers)
    $(CC) -c $(CFLAGS) -o $@ $&lt;

cc -c  -o program.o program.c
</code></pre>
<p>Make is mixing that information together an executing the proper commands in the proper order. But for a better explanation about how rules works see the section dedicated to rules.</p>
