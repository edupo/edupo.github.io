<p>Functions in make are called with the same syntax as the variables using <code>$(</code> and <code>)</code> sequence, the arguments are passed after a space in a comma-separated-list.</p>
<pre><code>$(wordlist one two three,two,three)
</code></pre>
<p>They can be used in the same contexts than variables (as prerequisites, inside recipes, as targets...) and you can nest as many as you want, so you can do some pretty nice processes.</p>
<pre><code>$ cat Makefile
path := $(home)/output
binaries := $(addprefix $(path),$(basename $(wildcard %.c))
default:
    @echo $(wildcard %.c)
    @echo $(binaries)

$ make
program1.c program2.c
/home/edupo/output/program1 /home/edupo/output/program2
</code></pre>
<p>Let see the binaries variable assignment more closer.</p>
<pre><code> binaries := $(addprefix $(path),$(basename $(wildcard %.c))
</code></pre>
<p>To understand how this statement works we need to read it from the most inner parenthesis.</p>
<ul>
<li>The first function executed is <code>wildcard</code> and it's argument is <code>%.c</code>. This function locates all the files in the <em>current working directory</em> that match the argument, so it will be locating all C source files available in the current directory.
<p>You can use <code>wildcard</code> to locate files inside folders relative to your current path. Just imagine that the stem (<code>%</code>) will be replacing the name of the file you are looking for, so if your lookup string looks like <code>../subfolder/%.c</code> it will do exactly what you are thinking.</p>
<p>This is a powerful characteristic, but I do not recommend to use it because you can over complicate your <em>Makefile</em>. The best practice is <strong>creating a <em>Makefile</em> per folder</strong> you have on your structure; If your <em>Makefiles</em> are automating a build process then make sense that every folder should create a binary (a library or executable) so that if one of such is a prerequisite of your final application <code>make</code> can call itself onto the desired folder.</p>
<p>Apparently the function has found in the example 2 source files:</p>
<pre><code>program1.c program2.c
</code></pre>
</li>
<li>The second function <code>basename</code> is extracting from each word all but the file name. Even if the file name contains an extension you will be filtering that. The path is kept so make sure to remove it using <code>notdir</code> if you are only interested on the file name.
<p>Looking to our example the string at this point should look like:</p>
<pre><code> program1 program2
</code></pre>
</li>
<li>Finally comes the <code>addprefix</code> function that will add the path to each word. If you want to prepend strings in make you can also use <em>variable assignments</em>
<pre><code> var := Hello, $(world)
</code></pre>
<p>But when your variables may contain many words <strong>this type of assignments should be avoided</strong> for more than static parameters definition.</p>
<p>After the execution of this part of the code you will get the desired final string:</p>
<pre><code>  /home/edupo/output/program1 /home/edupo/output/program2
</code></pre>
</li>
</ul>
<p>As you can see <code>make</code> is powerful processing strings in many ways. And not only that. You can display custom messages, break execution, doing loops through an array of words and much more.</p>
<p>You have a great <a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/make/manual/html_node/Functions.html#index-functions">reference</a> about make functions on GNU project project but after playing a little with them I recommend to take a look to this <a href="https://github.com/edupo/make-cheatsheet">cheatsheet</a>.</p>
<p>Anyway, using the function table of the cheatsheets append here a summary of all the functions for your reference, descriptions are minimized.</p>
